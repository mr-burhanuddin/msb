        <p className="fs-6">
          Dr. Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, a patron of education, has to his
          credit, the setting up of an international chain of schools under the
          name "Al-Madrasa-Tus-Saifiya-Tul-Burhaniyah" now known as the M. S. B.
          Educational Institutes. There are about nineteen such schools in
          countries such as India, Pakistan, Kenya, Tanzania, Madagascar and the
          United Arab Emirates. These institutions mirror all that a regular
          school should embody in providing complete preprimary, primary and
          secondary education with a curriculum that is enhanced by the learning
          of Islamic rudiments, thus meshing the secular with the religious. The
          MSB Educational Institute, Nagpur is affiliated to the ICSE board.
          Constant additionts to its infrastructure have been done over the past
          years including a change of Board from State Board to the ICSE in the
          year 2001. The School runs classes from Pre- Nursery to Std. X.The
          School has four Sections , Pre-Primary, Primary, Middle and Secondary
          ;each headed by a Section Head.At the moment there are two stream from
          Nursery to X. The average strength of a class is 30 with a student
          teacher ratio of 11:1. The aim of MSB Nagpur, as all MSB's, has been
          to focus on Tarbiyat and Taleem i.e. Holistic Education with grooming
          as per the culture of the Bohra Community. At MSB Nagpur, it is the
          aim not to produce only academically bright students, but to send into
          the world academically educated individuals, proud of their own
          culture and with their roots firmly fixed to the soil of their beliefs
          and traditions. We, at MSB, Nagpur understand that all students cannot
          be academically brilliant, as all fingers of a hand are not of one
          size, but as in the fingers, each individual has his / her own
          important place in society and is an asset to society. Hence academic
          brilliance takes a second seat to smart, well adjusted individuals
          each doing his / her best in a chosen field.

        <h3 className="text-info">PHILOSOPHY OF MSB</h3>
        <p className="fs-6">
          The school subscribes to the philosophy of the four learning centers
          as illustrated and elaborated by Dr Syedi Yusuf Bhaisaheb Najmuddin
          Saheb, comprising of the amalgamation of the Masjid, Madrasa ,Mujtama
          and Manzil, where all four combine to give a total learning experience
          for life. We house all four giving our students the exposure to all of
          these bringing out the best in them, benefiting not just them but the
          society , nation & world at large. The philosophy and outlook of the
          Madrasa system of education has been beautifully summarized in the
          words of Ayman Behnsaheb Kalimuddin, Director of the worldwide network
          of Madrasas: "We are trying to foster an Islamic way of thinking about
          all aspects of learning-geography, history, math, all of it. If we
          teach children about monsoons, we not only teach them the scientific
          causes for such weather conditions, but also the Qur'anic verses
          describing heavy rainfall as a sign of God's power. We do not see
          modern Western education as being antithetical to Islam at all: in
          today's world, a person must be thoroughly grounded in every form of
          knowledge in order to function in a wider society. But we try to give
          our students the Islamic basis to underline this education.

        <h3 className="text-info">OUR VISION</h3>
        <p className="fs-6">
          Keeping in line with the Vision of Aqa Maula, our students should be
          prepared to enable them to be entrepreneurs, but with a solid
          professional base. It is not that just because business is the major
          aim, education or professional qualifications are to be undermined; in
          fact, it attains a very important position because bussinesses run by
          professionals grow and flourish. To be a vibrant learning society in
          which the school works within the community and in partnership with
          the parents and other stake holders in the field of education. In our
          learning society learners will make good progress and achieve their
          potential. There will be continuous improvement and innovation in both
          learning and teaching. Teachers and students will be self improving
          and self evaluating. Curriculum will be broad, balanced, forward
          looking and prepare the young students for active citizenship and to
          lead. To raise the standards of English, Science and Mathematics among
          the students. To provide vocational training compulsorily to students
          under SUPW at V-IX level. To incorporate IT in our teaching learning
          methodologies. MSB, being a part of the vision of His Holiness Syedna
          Mohammed Burhanuddin Saheb TUS, enjoys his special blessings and
          therefore is truly a blessed educational venture, prospering with the
          grace of the Almighty. MSB offers something special for the basic
          schooling years in the form of an environment that focuses on the
          student. As, MSB devotes itself exclusively to educating the students
          in consonance with Deen, one finds an extra measure of enthusiasm,
          eagerness, support and encoragement at MSB. No stone is left unturned
          to ensure the success of our students not only aceadmically but also
          spiritually.
